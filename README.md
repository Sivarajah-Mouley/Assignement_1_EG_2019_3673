# Image Processing Assignment

This repository contains Python programs to perform various image processing operations. The assignment includes the following tasks:

1. Reduce the number of intensity levels in an image from 256 to 2.
2. Perform a simple spatial averaging of image pixels for different neighborhood sizes.
3. Rotate an image by 45 and 90 degrees.
4. Replace every 3x3 block of the image by their average, simulating image spatial resolution reduction.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries such as NumPy, and Matplotlib.
3. Run colab file to perform the corresponding image processing operation.
